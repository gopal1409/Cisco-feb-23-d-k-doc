#lets build an spring boot application
  ##in my local system i need to install jdk
133  apt install default-jdk
  #maven
  134  apt install maven
  #clone my application
  135  git clone https://github.com/gopal1409/spring-hello.git
  136  cd spring-hello/
    #mvn clean package will compile my app and create a runnable jar file
  137  mvn clean package
  138  ls
  #inside the target folder you can see the jar file 
  139  ls target/
    #execute the jar file using java -jar
  140  java -jar ./target/spring-boot-2-hello-world-1.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ##once you application is started open the browser 
    192.168.100.10:8080/hello
      ##this will show the hellow world page
      #after that press ctrl c in the terminal this will close the app
#we will convert thsi app into an container based image we will create a file called as docker file 
##inside the docker file we need to provide instruiction
[root@docker-engine spring-hello]$ touch dockerfile
[root@docker-engine spring-hello]$ ls
dockerfile  pom.xml  README.md  src  target

#to convert an application into an container based image we need to create a dokcer file in root directory of the folder
142  touch dockerfile
  143  ls
#inside the dockerfile we need to provide instruction copy from line 31 till 39 and paste it inside the docker file and save the file
  144  vi dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:11-jre-ubi9-minimal
#inside the container if i want to create a directory
WORKDIR /app
#on top of the base image i need to add my jar file which we have created earlier
COPY ./target/spring-boot-2-hello-world-1.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar /app/app.jar
#in place of copy u can use add instruction
#we need to put the executable file
#once the container is in running state we need to put the execution command
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app/app.jar"]

#to build the image docker build -t is tag the image will be build with this name 
  147  docker build -t skywalker .
##docker images will show the image created 
  148  docker images
#if you want to see the layer of the image replace the image id of skywaler
  149  docker image history 6162d5639911
#lets create a container with my sky walker image
  151  docker container run -d -p 85:8080 skywalker
#this will show there is container running
  152  docker ps
###we will now access the same from browser this time it is being served using a container
192.168.100.10:85/hello
